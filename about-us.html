Superiority and ROI (Return on Investment) potential of SAP and its high implementation and maintenance costs have given rise to new range of services known as <b>pre-configured IT/ERP solutions</b>.  Prior to the incorporation of Kamptos Technologies, the team have experience in developing few industry specific pre-configured IT solutions in the areas of Life sciences, Retail, AFS, Engineering and Food. These solutions were successfully deployed across 150 customers around the world during 2007-2011.
