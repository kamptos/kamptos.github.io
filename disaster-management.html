                                Emergencies arrive in many forms, they often require a &ldquo;whole government&rdquo; approach that includes community involvement. Despite high levels of commitment, poor coordination between relevant parties is the greatest impediment to efficient disaster management. What&#39;s needed is an &ldquo;all hazards, all agencies&rdquo; approach that spans government agencies and community groups to address a full range of potential emergencies.
                            </p>
                            <p>The primary objective is to optimize prevention, preparation, response, and recovery from any emergency &#45; regardless of cause, size, location, or complexity. The overarching goal is to reduce loss of life, damage to property, and harm to the environment. Integrated emergency management is best achieved through the creation of a single repository of information for planning, preparation, response, and recovery. This shared data resource must serve many parties, including emergency services organizations, government agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), private infrastructure operators, and community groups. Information in the repository must be secure, accessible, and relevant for many different users.  </p>
                            <p>Kamptos pre-configured SAP (EDMS) solutions for emergency and disaster management leverage the latest technology innovations, enabling faster anticipation of emergency dynamics and better-informed decision making. The software improves real-time visibility across agencies and systems by allowing participants to build a coherent information base and solution framework that supports optimized emergency planning, preparation, response, and recovery.</p>
